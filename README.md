# Panel-Regression-with-Expectation-Maximization
R code for Panel Data Analysis with Expectation Maximization iteration for missing values. Final models are heteroskedastic, so Robust Covariance Matrix is used. Since the panel analysis didn't produce any potential fixed effect models, Chow Test wasn't included.
